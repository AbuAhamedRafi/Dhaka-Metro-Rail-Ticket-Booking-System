# Dhaka-Metro-Rail-Ticket-Booking-System
This report outlines the design and implementation of a Google Cloud infrastructure for
the Dhaka Metro Rail Ticketing System. To support the functioning of the ticketing system, the
infrastructure makes use of a variety of elements, including Virtual Machines (VMs), Buckets,
Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), Subnets, VPC peering, and a SQL instance. The city's public
transportation system must include the Dhaka Metro Rail Ticketing System. A reliable and
scalable cloud infrastructure is required to manage ticket sales, revenue, and passenger
information effectively. The design and deployment of a Google Cloud infrastructure for the
Dhaka Metro Rail Ticketing System are presented in this study.
